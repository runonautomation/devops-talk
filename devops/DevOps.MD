 DevOps Principles:
 - Satisfy the customer
 - Welcome changing requirements
 - Delivery of working functionality frequently
 - NFR are important
 - Infrastructure as code
 - Provide all the needed support to each team
 - Progess is delivered working software
 - Technical excellence
 - KISS principle
 - Best design comes from self-organized teams
 - Regular retrospecitive and development

## DevOps Practices 
 - Cooperation in with stakeholders
 Developers, operations staff, and support people must work closely together on a regular basis to get real-time feedback on product needs.
  
 - Automated Testing 
 
 Encourage usage of TDD/BDD, provide options for fase and effective testing to QA teams.
  
 - Configuration Management
 Software need to be aware of the configuration model.
  
 - Change Management
  
 - Continuous Integration
 Continuous integration (CI) is the discipline of building and validating a project, through automated regression testing and code analysis.

 - Application Monitoring
   
 - Application Monitoring

 - Toolchain
 
#### Emerging practices
- Adaptive feature delivery
- Containers In Production
- Scaling 
- Complementary to marketing and sales campaigns

#### Deployment specific practices
- Blue-greep deploymne


## Modern DevOps operating solutions architecture patterns
#### DevOps team should work closely with stakehodlers and help with architecture definition and deployment implementation. 
#### Common patterns:
- SOA and microservices
- Distributed and highly-scaleable, upon demand.
- Build to change vs last
- Well established separation of concerns
- Data partitioning that fits architectural needs, multiple engines and databases
- Loosely-coupled
- Integration with processing systems, applications, message queues
- Synchronous as well as asynchronous processing
